\usage{
qoac_statistics(INR_meas, to = max(INR_meas$INR_date), from = to - 365,
  range.lower = 2, range.upper = 3, period_id = NA_character_,
  interpolate_end = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{INR_meas}{Data.frame with (at least) the following columns:

* INR_date, a date object with the date of the INR measurement
* INR, the international normalised ratio.}

\item{to, from}{Define the period over which the calculcation will take place; default to the latest measurement and 1 year before. Can be a vector, together with `period_id`}

\item{range.lower, range.upper}{Define the target range for the time within target range}

\item{period_id}{Names for the periods defined by _to_, _from_}

\item{interpolate_end}{If there are measurements after *to*, should they be used to interpolate? Defaults to FALSE.}

\description{
Calculate summary measures for quality of anticoagulation (QOAC) with VKA on a certain time period.
Calculates the time within the therapeutic range (TTR) based on the Rosendaal method,
the variance growth rate according to Cannegieter,
and the sdtINR according to Lind (2012).
INR measurements more than 56 days apart will not be interpolated.
